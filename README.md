# Evaluating the accuracy of the prediction of stargazers in open source projects
- Task: To study which prediction model has the highest accuracy in predicting the number of stars for a GitHub repository

## Initial Experimental Results
- A total of 24 experiments have been applied to the prepared dataset using basic machine learning models. Here is the comparison among them.
